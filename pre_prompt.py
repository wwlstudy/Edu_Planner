# Part 1: Explanation of knowledge points
An algebraic equation is a mathematical equation containing unknown numbers, and its general form is ax+b=c. Among them, a, b, c are known numbers, and x is an unknown number. The process of solving an algebraic equation is to find the value of x that makes the equation true.

The basic methods for solving algebraic equations are as follows:
- Moving term method: According to the properties of the equation, move the unknown number to one side and the known number to the other side until the unknown number is independent.
- Equivalent deformation method: Through equivalent deformation of the equation, the equation is reduced to a simpler form, and finally the value of the unknown is obtained.
- Substitution method: Substituting known numbers into the equation to find the value of the unknown.
- Elimination method: For a system of equations containing two unknowns, one of the unknowns is eliminated through appropriate deformation, thereby transforming it into an equation containing only one unknown.
- Factoring: Factor the equation to find the value of the unknown.

In the process of solving algebraic equations, you need to pay attention to maintaining a balance on both sides of the equation and ensuring that the transformations at each step are equivalent to avoid introducing new errors.

# Part 2: Explanation of exercise
Question 1:
    A brownie recipe is asking for 350 grams of sugar, and a pound cake recipe requires 270 more grams of sugar than a brownie recipe. How many grams of sugar are needed for the pound cake? 
Solution: 
    Step 1: Identify the amount of sugar needed for the brownie recipe, which is 350 grams. 
    Step 2: Understand that the pound cake recipe requires 270 more grams of sugar than the brownie recipe. 
    Step 3: Add the additional 270 grams of sugar to the 350 grams required for the brownie recipe. 
    Step 4: The total amount of sugar needed for the pound cake recipe is 350 grams + 270 grams = 620 grams.
